ABSA is a terminal based sysem assistent (audio based system asistent) to do small taskes like opening browers , other installed apps, play music on an inbuilt player or run audio search (also inbuilt) on ubuntu systems only (currently)
It,just like its developer, is always learning so when an unknown command or query is passed it makes a note of it in improvement file
