# ABSA
ABSA is an audio based system asistent to do small taskes like opening browers , other installed apps, play music on an inbuilt player or run audio search (also inbuilt) on ubuntu systems only (currently)
It,just like its developer, is always learning so when an unknown command or query is passed it makes a note of it in improvement file also the user has the option of god mode in which a person can say commandline arguments and will directly be executed
In case of a missing modules it is programed to use os module to install them in your pc if executing first time it is recommended to do so in a terminal
To get strated just download the file and run it usnig python3, you can also add python3 ABSA.py to your keyboard shortcuts for easy opening of the program
